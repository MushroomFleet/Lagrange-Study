Here are three high-fidelity image generation prompts tailored to recreate the style and scientific density of the maps we programmed. These are optimized for "Pro" generation engines (like Midjourney v6 or DALL-E 3) to achieve that clean, dark-mode data visualization aesthetic.

### **Prompt 1: The Global Earth-Sun Gravity Well**
> **Prompt:** Scientific visualization of a 2D topographic contour map representing the Restricted Three-Body Problem. A massive gravity well for the Sun on the left and a smaller, sharper gravity well for Earth on the right. Intricate white glowing isolines on a deep void background. The color palette is a smooth gradient from deep purple to blazing orange (magma colormap). The contours pinch together to form a saddle point exactly between the two bodies (L1) and behind the smaller body (L2). High contrast, 8k resolution, flat vector style, mathematical precision, clean lines. --ar 16:9

### **Prompt 2: The Tactical Earth-L2 Hill Sphere (Zoomed)**
> **Prompt:** A tactical zoomed-in schematic of Earth's gravitational Hill Sphere. Dark space background with a "heat map" style potential field using an inferno palette (black to deep red to yellow). The central focus is Earth in blue, surrounded by a figure-8 shaped Roche lobe contour. Two specific glowing neon dashed lines (cyan and magenta) mark the L1 and L2 gateways. A delicate white dotted loop illustrates a Halo orbit around the L2 point. HUD aesthetic, digital telemetry style, crisp vector graphics, deep black background, highly detailed. --ar 16:9

### **Prompt 3: The Log-Polar Solar System Archipelago**
> **Prompt:** Abstract data art of the Solar System's gravity wells arranged in a logarithmic spiral. A top-down view showing Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter as isolated "islands" of gravity spiraling outward from a central point. Each planet is surrounded by its own topographic contour field. Jupiter (outermost) features scattered particle clouds representing Trojan asteroids at triangular points. The aesthetic is a complex radial chart on a pitch-black background. Thin, faint white circular orbit lines connecting the islands. Cyberpunk scientific interface, multicolor planetary markers, high complexity, 2k resolution. --aspect 1:1
